# Web_Scraping_Bourse_Direct_News

Build a GUI using KivyMD for my scraping script of some news site.

You will find 2 scraping .py files:
image_scrapping.py: retrieve images of the articles
Web_Scraping_Bourse_Direct_Just_Titles: retrieve titles and hyperlinks

The 2 .txt files are used to store the data of articles titles and hyperlinks
The folder img_articles, for the images

The kivy gui is composed of 2 files:
kivy_app.py
News.kv
